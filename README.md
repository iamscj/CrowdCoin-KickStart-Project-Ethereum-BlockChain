# CrowdCoin

**CrowdCoin** is a decentralized application (DApp) built on the Ethereum blockchain using Solidity smart contracts and a React/Next.js frontend. It allows users to create and contribute to crowdfunding campaigns, providing a transparent and secure way to raise funds for various projects.

## Features

- **Campaign Creation**: Users can create new crowdfunding campaigns by specifying a minimum contribution amount.
- **Contribution**: Participants can contribute to campaigns by sending Ether (ETH) to the smart contract.
- **Request Creation**: Campaign managers can create spending requests, specifying a description, value, and recipient address.
- **Approval Process**: Contributors can approve spending requests, ensuring transparency and consensus among campaign participants.
- **Finalization**: Once a spending request has received approval from more than 50% of the contributors, the campaign manager can finalize the request, transferring the funds to the designated recipient.
- **Campaign Tracking**: Campaigns provide summary information, including the minimum contribution amount, total funds raised, number of requests, number of contributors, and the campaign manager's address.
- **Frontend Interface**: The frontend application is built using React and Next.js, offering a user-friendly and responsive interface.

This project demonstrates the power of blockchain technology and decentralized crowdfunding, enabling secure and transparent fundraising for various causes and initiatives.
